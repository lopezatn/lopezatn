👋 Whoami

**Junior Cloud / DevOps Engineer focused on reliability, automation, and observability in AWS and Linux environments, built through hands-on operation of real infrastructure.**

I design, build, and operate cloud systems to understand how they behave under normal conditions and how they fail.  
My approach is practical and iterative: automate first, observe signals, troubleshoot from fundamentals, and improve reliability over time.

I focus on clear, maintainable infrastructure and operational workflows that reflect real production concerns.
